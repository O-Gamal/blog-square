As we develop our online presence, we recognized a need to better define our brand color palette. It was not only about achieving a unified brand image, it was also to ensure our brand reflected our values and differentiation. So at the beginning of 2022, we went through the process of refreshing our colors. Here is how we did it.</p><p id="6ab9" class="pw-post-body-paragraph acs act abo bv b acu acv wl acw acx acy wo acz aea aeb aec aed aee aef aeg aeh aei aej aek ael aem rj by" data-selectable-paragraph="">The science behind color is fascinating. We can see it at play everywhere. Its effects span from our individual experience to the function of the natural world. It’s in the dynamics between all life and the environments in which they exist. We recognized that to work with color is to tap into something much larger than just color. It’s about influencing feelings and behaviors, and we needed to be strategic about it.</p><figure class="aeq aer aes aet zj aeu sf sg paragraph-image"><div role="button" tabindex="0" class="agc agd cu age ae agf"><div class="sf sg arb"><img alt="" class="ae aev aew" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*akz9XNum0zk_gpbh7uRb8g.png" loading="lazy" role="presentation" width="700" height="394"></div></div></figure><p id="ddd0" class="pw-post-body-paragraph acs act abo bv b acu acv wl acw acx acy wo acz aea aeb aec aed aee aef aeg aeh aei aej aek ael aem rj by" data-selectable-paragraph="">We first created a framework to help us identify the personality traits of Jobox. We represented each personality trait on a spectrum going from one trait to its opposite. We then asked our team members to place Jobox on that spectrum based on how they perceived the brand. We overlaid these results to identify patterns about the company’s personality. Finally, we turned these results into Brand Adjectives that articulated the tone, voice, and personality of Jobox.</p><figure class="aeq aer aes aet zj aeu sf sg paragraph-image"><div role="button" tabindex="0" class="agc agd cu age ae agf"><div class="sf sg arb"><img alt="" class="ae aev aew" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*xUg1YLXYKDWIU8AyQ1HfLA.png" loading="lazy" role="presentation" width="700" height="394"></div></div></figure><p id="3937" class="pw-post-body-paragraph acs act abo bv b acu acv wl acw acx acy wo acz aea aeb aec aed aee aef aeg aeh aei aej aek ael aem rj by" data-selectable-paragraph="">We also needed to know color theory to guide us in our thinking. Each color and color relationship projects a set of qualities, and we wanted to be aware of these as we moved into our initial palette explorations. So we carried out an analysis of Color Psychology as it pertains to branding and marketing. We looked at colors and their relationships, and paid particular attention to the importance of temperature.</p><figure class="aeq aer aes aet zj aeu sf sg paragraph-image"><div role="button" tabindex="0" class="agc agd cu age ae agf"><div class="sf sg arb"><img alt="" class="ae aev aew" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*v89yrLhK0E3rAjOWoZ3VMg.png" loading="lazy" role="presentation" width="700" height="394"></div></div></figure><p id="6637" class="pw-post-body-paragraph acs act abo bv b acu acv wl acw acx acy wo acz aea aeb aec aed aee aef aeg aeh aei aej aek ael aem rj by" data-selectable-paragraph="">Armed with our Brand Adjectives and a working knowledge of Color Psychology, we started our initial palette exploration. We wanted to see how colors would interact when informed by our initial research. Our research kept suggesting that two types of color schemes would work best. One one hand, we needed to use complementary and split-complementary color relationships to convey the energy of a start-up. On the other hand, analogous and monochromatic color schemes could help us illustrate the more professional, methodical, and practical side of the brand. We experimented with these relationships and learned a lot. But these initial explorations were limiting in their ability to inform color ratios and application. This illuminated a need to take a new direction in the process and led us to the Competitive Analysis.</p><figure class="aeq aer aes aet zj aeu sf sg paragraph-image"><div role="button" tabindex="0" class="agc agd cu age ae agf"><div class="sf sg arb"><img alt="" class="ae aev aew" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*jKZTRjHQtbIasHi9GEVqMQ.png" loading="lazy" role="presentation" width="700" height="394"></div></div></figure><p id="e214" class="pw-post-body-paragraph acs act abo bv b acu acv wl acw acx acy wo acz aea aeb aec aed aee aef aeg aeh aei aej aek ael aem rj by" data-selectable-paragraph="">We carried out a competitive analysis to better understand how color is used at the intersection of Branding and UX. We analyzed approximately 40 websites across a variety of sectors, including tech and home services. We took a screenshot of these websites and rebuilt them using colored squares. As we did this, we articulated the feelings and characteristics conveyed by each page. This allowed us to experience first hand how these pages were built from a color perspective. It showed us how color proportions and relationships affect user perception and navigation.</p><p id="5775" class="pw-post-body-paragraph acs act abo bv b acu acv wl acw acx acy wo acz aea aeb aec aed aee aef aeg aeh aei aej aek ael aem rj by" data-selectable-paragraph="">Now equipped with the findings of our Competitive Analysis, we started part two of our palette explorations. This time, we defined the proportions of our base and accent colors to see how they would impact the palette. We created three elaborate color palettes. From these three palettes, we felt one aligned particularly well with the results of our research. It’s a split-complementary color scheme that uses a range of warm, analogous pastel accent colors over a set of cooler base blues, a base purple, and a base off-white.</p><figure class="aeq aer aes aet zj aeu sf sg paragraph-image"><div role="button" tabindex="0" class="agc agd cu age ae agf"><div class="sf sg awq"><img alt="" class="ae aev aew" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*S9xJqPdRcPeU3Zb2-Eox_Q.png" loading="lazy" role="presentation" width="700" height="394"></div></div></figure><p id="e01b" class="pw-post-body-paragraph acs act abo bv b acu acv wl acw acx acy wo acz aea aeb aec aed aee aef aeg aeh aei aej aek ael aem rj by" data-selectable-paragraph="">A particular interesting part of this project was the evolution of the Jobox blue. We knew we wanted to keep the Jobox blue as a primary brand color. But we shifted it from a primary blue to one that contained more red. The new blue bent towards our brand purple and warm accent colors, harmonizing it with the rest of the palette.</p><figure class="aeq aer aes aet zj aeu sf sg paragraph-image"><div role="button" tabindex="0" class="agc agd cu age ae agf"><div class="sf sg arb"><img alt="" class="ae aev aew" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*nci24HOYOUqyklHXAUKv0w.png" loading="lazy" role="presentation" width="700" height="394"></div></div></figure><p id="09b9" class="pw-post-body-paragraph acs act abo bv b acu acv wl acw acx acy wo acz aea aeb aec aed aee aef aeg aeh aei aej aek ael aem rj by" data-selectable-paragraph="">With our chosen palette, we were now able to move into the identity phase. We explored the potential of our chosen palette by applying it to our website and mobile app. We tried different color applications, ratios, and warm and cool temperature treatments. These explorations led us to a ratio and application system which aligned with our initial research. It also created a natural evolution from our former brand colors, and differentiated Jobox within the market in which it operates.</p><figure class="aeq aer aes aet zj aeu sf sg paragraph-image"><div role="button" tabindex="0" class="agc agd cu age ae agf"><div class="sf sg arb"><img alt="" class="ae aev aew" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*lR9yJW8-uWouCJux4B01jA.png" loading="lazy" role="presentation" width="700" height="394"></div></div></figure><p id="04f4" class="pw-post-body-paragraph acs act abo bv b acu acv wl acw acx acy wo acz aea aeb aec aed aee aef aeg aeh aei aej aek ael aem rj by" data-selectable-paragraph="">Colors are such an important part of a brand experience. Often companies dismiss colors as just a pretty asset that is nice to have. But colors reflect the brand personality. They also influence user behavior, and can make a real impact on revenue.

The artificial neurons that make neural networks are inspired by biological neurons.</p><p id="fc0c" class="pw-post-body-paragraph acs act abo tt b acu acv wl acw acx acy wo acz aea aeb aec aed aee aef aeg aeh aei aej aek ael aem rj aub" data-selectable-paragraph="">In mammalian brain, we have billions of neural networks. For example, human brain has 100 billion neurons with 100 trillion connections. The neuron receives signals and through a chemical reaction a decision is made whether the neuron should send signal to other neurons through axon. All our brain activities are carried out by these 100 billion neuron and 100 trillion connections between the neurons. Thus, it is astounding to think how simple units such as neurons, when they come together in billions could do amazing tasks.</p><figure class="aeq aer aes aet zj aeu sf sg paragraph-image"><div class="sf sg ave"><img alt="" class="ae aev aew" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/573/1*iZfdPEerFJRZ6zQtciKegA.png" loading="lazy" role="presentation" width="573" height="382"></div><figcaption class="qy jt zb sf sg agg agh bv b bw bx aua" data-selectable-paragraph="">neuron</figcaption></figure><p id="50da" class="pw-post-body-paragraph acs act abo tt b acu acv wl acw acx acy wo acz aea aeb aec aed aee aef aeg aeh aei aej aek ael aem rj aub" data-selectable-paragraph="">The neural network that we use in machine learning is a web of artificial neurons. As shown in below picture, neurons collect signals from other neurons. The x1, x2, x3 could be outputs from other neurons. Based on the strengths of the signals which are encoded in the weights, these signals get amplified as per their weights and all these get added up and given to a non-linear function, which decides the output. The other term to note down here is the bias-term -’b’ which is a constant added along with the weighted signals. Most of the artificial neural networks have the bias term.</p><p id="7c76" class="pw-post-body-paragraph acs act abo tt b acu acv wl acw acx acy wo acz aea aeb aec aed aee aef aeg aeh aei aej aek ael aem rj aub" data-selectable-paragraph="">Next, lets look at the non-linear function ‘g’. Before the function ‘g’, what we have is a summation of weighted signals which is a linear function. If we remove the non-linear function (g) from the neural networks, then when signals pass from one neuron to next, they would always remain a linear combinations of initial signals, no matter how many neurons are there in the sequence from input to output. Thus, the non-linear function ‘g’ plays an important role in modeling the input-output relationship using complex functions. It is also called as activation function.</p><p id="69c4" class="pw-post-body-paragraph acs act abo tt b acu acv wl acw acx acy wo acz aea aeb aec aed aee aef aeg aeh aei aej aek ael aem rj aub avf" data-selectable-paragraph=""><span class="y avg avh avi ov avj avk avl avm avn cu">T</span><strong class="tt he">ypes of activation functions</strong>:<br><strong class="tt he">Step function</strong>: It gives 1 or 0 binary output.

But it is not used much anymore. <br><strong class="tt he">Sigmoid function</strong>: The below diagram shows sigmoid function. Similar to sigmoid function, we have tanh hyperbolic tangent function which is the green line. The sigmoid function goes closer to 0 for large negative values and closer to 1 for large positive values. It approximates step function by not taking sharp transitions. <br>In hyperbolic tangent the two sides are -1 and +1; instead of 0 and 1. For large negative values, it goes closer to -1 and for large positive values, it goes closer to +1. But qualitatively, it is the same activation function like sigmoid function.<br><strong class="tt he">Rectified linear unit</strong>: Whenever the weighted sum of inputs is less than 0, then the output is 0 and whenever the weighted sum is greater than 0, the output is same value of input. It basically suppresses all negative values and lets positive values go as it is. <br><strong class="tt he">Softmax</strong>: While step or sigmoid function is used in binary classification, softmax could be used in n-class classification. <br><strong class="tt he">Linear</strong>: In linear function, the output is same as the input. Unlike other functions, this allows large range of values in output and thus mainly used where the output value could have a wide range such as in regression problems.</p><p id="9f51" class="pw-post-body-paragraph acs act abo tt b acu acv wl acw acx acy wo acz aea aeb aec aed aee aef aeg aeh aei aej aek ael aem rj aub" data-selectable-paragraph=""><strong class="tt he">More details on activation functions:<br></strong>As seen before, step function divides the input space into two halves-&gt; 0 and 1. When we want to learn something about the input by changing the weights of the inputs in a trail and error fashion, we will not be able to learn anything using step function as the slope is 0. On the other hand, when we make changes to the weights in sigmoid function, we can observe whether the output is increasing or decreasing with respect to small changes in weights as the slope is not 0.</p><p id="98fc" class="pw-post-body-paragraph acs act abo tt b acu acv wl acw acx acy wo acz aea aeb aec aed aee aef aeg aeh aei aej aek ael aem rj aub" data-selectable-paragraph="">The sigmoid function is a smoother approximation of step function. When we are learning, we try to change the weights of input or the bias term but not the inputs. For example, if ‘x’ is an input and w1x + b is the output of the function, we can change the w1 or b but not x. <br>When we change the bias term ‘b’ to negative or positive, we shift the mid-point of the graph to left or right. When b is 0 -&gt;mid-point is at the center, when negative-&gt; mid-point moves to right and when positive-&gt;mid-point moves to left. When we change the weight ‘w1’, for large values of w1-&gt; the transition would be sharp and for small values of w1-&gt; the transition is not so steep. <br>Thus, when we are tuning a neural network, if one of the neurons has a sigmoid function, then by changing weights or bias, we could have above discussed changes in the output. This gives us direction on how to change weights in backward propagation or learning algorithms so that we can drive output in desired direction.</p><p id="b963" class="pw-post-body-paragraph acs act abo tt b acu acv wl acw acx acy wo acz aea aeb aec aed aee aef aeg aeh aei aej aek ael aem rj aub" data-selectable-paragraph="">A relatively new activation function that has gained popularity is ‘Rectified linear unit (ReLU)’. The problem with sigmoid is for large values of inputs (both positive and negative), sigmoid doesn’t change much with change in input. Whereas the ReLU is flat only on the negative side and never flat on positive side. Thus, for one half of the input, ReLU give some direction on whether weight should be increased or decreased, while for other half, it will not give any direction. For a well initiated neural network, weights are randomly initialized and for about half the inputs, we will get some direction to train the neural network. However, ReLU will never be used at the output node. The output from the neural network is either probability of a class or continuous regression output. ReLU output could go above 1 whereas for a probability use case, we want the value range from 0 to 1 and thus we would go for sigmoid or its generalization -Softmax. For regression problem, we would not want any restrictions on negative values and thus go for ‘Linear unit’ and not ReLU. Thus, ReLU is used only for hidden neurons.</p><p id="02a3" class="pw-post-body-paragraph acs act abo tt b acu acv wl acw acx acy wo acz aea aeb aec aed aee aef aeg aeh aei aej aek ael aem rj aub" data-selectable-paragraph=""><strong class="tt he">Conclusion:<br></strong>Quick summary for selecting the right activation function,<br>* Sigmoid for binary classification output<br>* Tanh for output range in {-1,+1}<br>* Softmax for n-array classification<br>* Linear for regression <br>* ReLU for internal nodes (non-output)</p><p id="5a04" class="pw-post-body-paragraph acs act abo tt b acu acv wl acw acx acy wo acz aea aeb aec aed aee aef aeg aeh aei aej aek ael aem rj aub" data-selectable-paragraph="">We can discuss the basic structure of a neural network in the next blog.</p>`,

The carbon border tax–called the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM)–is the first rule of its kind and will have ramifications for the global trading market, from consumers to non-EU manufacturers trying to sell their products in the EU.</p><p id="492c" class="pw-post-body-paragraph acs act abo tt b acu acv wl acw acx acy wo acz aea aeb aec aed aee aef aeg aeh aei aej aek ael aem rj by" data-selectable-paragraph="">What is a carbon border tax, and why does the EU need one?

In 2005, the ETS set up a cap and trade-style carbon trading market in the European Union, in which manufacturers in the EU need to buy a permit for every ton of CO2 they produce. The prices of these permits are set according to the EU’s carbon pricing market, which essentially pins a price on carbon emissions to account for the negative externalities associated with emitting carbon. The EU’s carbon price at the time of writing was around <a class="ay aen" href="https://ember-climate.org/data/data-tools/carbon-price-viewer/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">85 Euros per ton of CO2</a>.</p><figure class="aeq aer aes aet zj aeu sf sg paragraph-image"><div role="button" tabindex="0" class="agc agd cu age ae agf"><div class="sf sg atb"><img alt="" class="ae aev aew" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/700/0*csJXsim49G6ARQu-" loading="lazy" role="presentation" width="700" height="394"></div></div><figcaption class="qy jt zb sf sg agg agh bv b bw bx ho" data-selectable-paragraph="">Image courtesy of <a class="ay aen" href="https://www.devex.com/news/in-brief-european-parliament-makes-global-supply-chain-push-99318" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Devex</a>.</figcaption></figure><p id="d23b" class="pw-post-body-paragraph acs act abo tt b acu acv wl acw acx acy wo acz aea aeb aec aed aee aef aeg aeh aei aej aek ael aem rj by" data-selectable-paragraph="">The problem with this sort of cap and trade system is that foreign manufacturers operating in countries without climate regulations are able to emit carbon free of cost, drastically reducing their manufacturing costs compared to their counterparts subject to stricter regulations. This places EU manufacturers at a cost disadvantage, resulting in <a class="ay aen" href="https://www.bcg.com/publications/2021/eu-carbon-border-tax" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">“carbon leakage,” or the losing out of sales to cheaper imports from countries</a> with more lax climate rules. Similarly, the emissions trading system runs the risk of EU manufacturers simply relocating offshore, enabling them to avoid the cost of carbon in the manufacturing process. The EU currently provides some free carbon permits to its manufacturers to compensate for these forms of leakage, but it’s phasing out these free permits and trying to long-term correct for carbon leakage by carbon-taxing manufacturers from countries without climate regulation.</p><p id="8f62" class="pw-post-body-paragraph acs act abo tt b acu acv wl acw acx acy wo acz aea aeb aec aed aee aef aeg aeh aei aej aek ael aem rj by" data-selectable-paragraph="">All this means that <strong class="tt he">while carbon pricing is a familiar concept in climate regulation, CBAM is the first policy to apply carbon pricing to imported or traded goods</strong>, essentially turning the price into a tariff to level the playing field for EU manufacturers.</p><p id="7de9" class="pw-post-body-paragraph acs act abo tt b acu acv wl acw acx acy wo acz aea aeb aec aed aee aef aeg aeh aei aej aek ael aem rj by" data-selectable-paragraph=""><strong class="tt he">Why you should care</strong></p><p id="6d99" class="pw-post-body-paragraph acs act abo tt b acu acv wl acw acx acy wo acz aea aeb aec aed aee aef aeg aeh aei aej aek ael aem rj by" data-selectable-paragraph="">How does the carbon border tax impact you as a consumer?

When the protest calmed down, I approached a handful of locals for interviews to gauge people’s opinions about the current situation.</p><p id="4c0e" class="pw-post-body-paragraph acs act abo tt b acu acv wl acw acx acy wo acz aea aeb aec aed aee aef aeg aeh aei aej aek ael aem rj by" data-selectable-paragraph="">“We are protesting about this channel that is Russian…we don’t want this channel to broadcast propaganda inside Ukraine,” said Masha, a young Ukrainian protester.</p><p id="f8f6" class="pw-post-body-paragraph acs act abo tt b acu acv wl acw acx acy wo acz aea aeb aec aed aee aef aeg aeh aei aej aek ael aem rj by" data-selectable-paragraph="">Masha went on to tell me that she hoped that the war would end and that her husband and friends would come home and that Ukraine would have a peaceful future with a good economy and be a part of the European Union.

This would be the last assignment in Kyiv we would cover before Russian troops invaded.

Google Maps became less accurate during the invasion, although this was likely to have been instigated by the Ukrainian authorities so as to mislead the Russian military advancing from inside the country. Other journalists I spoke to shared similar struggles, particularly with map accuracy on their devices. It isn’t just journalists who are targeted by cyberattacks; the Ukrainian government has also had to contend with this issue for some time now.</p><p id="d531" class="pw-post-body-paragraph acs act abo tt b acu acv wl acw acx acy wo acz aea aeb aec aed aee aef aeg aeh aei aej aek ael aem rj by" data-selectable-paragraph="">It goes without saying that many journalists in Ukraine are having an extremely difficult time.

I stopped at one carriage’s exit and stared out of the window at the sprawling countryside in front of me.
